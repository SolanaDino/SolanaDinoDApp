## Overview

### What is DINO
Dino is a token which ultimately allows for the minting of Dino NFTs through a process which creates, incubates, and hatches eggs. The Dino NFT is intended to ultimately have a game dynamic to it whereby the Dino NFTs are characters in a game, and/or provide additional capability within a game.  Details of this game are not flushed out, but rather will be a product of development through feedback with the community - and driven by the community. One thing is for certain, Dino NFTs will be fun and extremely rare.

## Phases of development

### Phase 1 - Initial distribution; community creation
Our initial distribution, airdrop, discord, members, etc

### Phase 2 - Staking, DINOEGG creation
A smart contract developer was secured and developed our initial staking contract.  This contract allows DINO to be staked to earn DINOEGG at a rate of 1 DINOEGG per 100k DINO staked over 30 days.  This rate will cut in half every 60 days starting on the 15th of Spetember 2021, and again every 60 days after.  This rate rewards early stakers with more DINOEGG, yet continues to provide an endless stream of DINOEGG.

More airdrops will occur during this phase to spread DINO around further.  Partnerships possible to help draw in new members and holders.

### Phase 3 - Liquidity
As DINO single token rewards cut in half, a new way to earn DINOEGG will be introduced through providing liquidity to the DINO and DINOEGG markets.  Using a farming rewards contract and an AMM LP (TBD), rewards of DINOEGG will be given to liquidity providers of these tokens initially just with DINO.

A DINOEGG DEX market will be created in an effort to have price discovery on DINOEGG.  Given the rarity of DINOEGG, an interesting market dynamic will be at play on the price of this token.  Once this market settles, an additional farming rewards pool will be available for a new DINOEGG LP.

More airdrops will occur during this phase to spread DINO around further.  Partnerships possible to help draw in new members and holders.

Possible token burning to increase value of DINO should not enough unique airdrop recipients be found.

### Phase 4 - DINOEGG -> Dino Egg NFT minting
Many holders have more than a full DINOEGG at this point, and a mechanism to turn 1.00 DINOEGG into a Dino EGG NFT*.  These tokens are not true NFTs, but rather non-divisible tokens of a certain rarity type.  There will be levels of egg rarity that you are given based on a combination of randomness (custom VRF or hopefully a third party VRF solution available), and other factors such as maybe staking LP to improve "luck" during the Dino Egg minting.  

A market should evolve around Dino Egg NFTs* - and a proper market place to put eggs up for auction should be created to allow them to be sold.

### Phase 5 - Dino Egg NFT incubating
Dino Egg NFTs can in fact be hatched into baby dinos.  This will have a similar dynamic to turning DINOEGG into Dino Egg NFT - with the rarity of the egg combined with luck and similar staking luck bonuses.

### Phase 6 - Dino Egg hatching
You've hatched a dino! You'll be able to name your Dino NFT, and it will have assigned traints as is seen in typical RPG type games - level, luck, strength, stamina, courage, magic, etc

### Phase N - The Dino Entertainment Future
What could be next?
